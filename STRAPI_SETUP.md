   npm run develop
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:1337/admin

2. **Go to Settings** → **Roles** → **Public**

3. **Enable these permissions for Product**:
   - ✅ find (view all products)
   - ✅ findOne (view single product)
   
4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Add Test Products

1. **Go to Content Manager** → **Product**
2. **Click "Create new entry"**

   - Description: "This is an amazing product..."
   - Category: "E-commerce"
   - Product_image: Upload an image
   - Comment: "Great product!"
   - Rating_profile_image: Upload a profile picture

4. **Click "Save"** then **"Publish"**
