## 🎉 **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Product Comments Now Working!** ✓

- ✅ Added Rich Text parser to properly display comment text

  - Commenter name
  - Comment text  
  - Rating (1-5 stars)
  - Profile image placeholder (if you add the field later)

### 2. **Code Improvements** ✓

## 🎯 **What You Need to Do:**

### **Test the Comments:**
1. Go to your product page: http://localhost:3005
2. Click on a product (e.g., "TradingView API")
3. Scroll down to **"Reviews & Comments"** section
4. You should now see:
   - **EmmyDc** - "I like this product tool it work for my project" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - **Iyawo emmyDc** - "I dont like this product" ⭐

### **Fix the "What's Included" Items:**

The included items are showing as null because they need to be properly saved in Strapi.

**Follow these steps:**

1. **Open Strapi Admin:** http://localhost:1337/admin
2. **Go to Content Manager** → **Product** → **TradingView API**
3. **Scroll to "IncludedItem" section**
4. **For EACH item:**
   - Click the dropdown arrow to expand it
   - Fill the **"title"** field
   - Examples:
     - `Full json path for all language`
     - `24/7 Customer Support`
     - `Free lifetime updates`
     - `Complete API documentation`
5. **Click "Save"** button (top right)
6. **Click "Publish"** button
