# ✅ Product-Specific Payments - IMPLEMENTED!

## 🎯 **What's New:**

Each product now has its **own payment settings**! No more shared payment links for all products.

---

## 📋 **Quick Start - 3 Simple Steps:**

### **Step 1: Add Fields to Strapi (One Time Setup)**

Go to Strapi → Content-Type Builder → Product → Add these 5 fields:

1. **Stripe_Payment_Link** (Text)
2. **Paystack_Payment_Link** (Text)
3. **BTC_Wallet_Address** (Text)
4. **ETH_Wallet_Address** (Text)
5. **USDT_Wallet_Address** (Text)

Click "Save" and wait for Strapi to restart.

---

### **Step 2: Add Payment Info to Each Product**

Go to Strapi → Content Manager → Product → Edit product:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Product: API-FOOTBALL                 │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Price: $99.99                         │
│                                       │
│ Stripe Payment Link:                  │
│ [Your Stripe link for $99.99]        │
│                                       │
│ Paystack Payment Link:                │
│ [Your Paystack link for $99.99]      │
│                                       │
│ BTC Wallet Address:                   │
│ [Your Bitcoin address]                │
│                                       │
│ ETH Wallet Address:                   │
│ [Your Ethereum address]               │
│                                       │
│ USDT Wallet Address:                  │
│ [Your USDT address]                   │
│                                       │
│           [Save]                      │

### **Step 3: Test It**

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click any product
3. Click "Buy Now"
4. Try each payment method (Stripe, Paystack, Crypto)
5. Each product now uses its own payment links! ✅

## 🎨 **How It Works:**

### **Before:**
```
Product A ($50)  ┐
Product B ($100) ├──→ Same Payment Link ❌
Product C ($200) ┘
```

### **Now:**
```
Product A ($50)  → Stripe Link A (for $50)  ✅
Product B ($100) → Stripe Link B (for $100) ✅
Product C ($200) → Stripe Link C (for $200) ✅
```

---

## 💳 **Payment Methods Per Product:**

Each product can have:
- ✅ **Stripe Payment Link** - Redirects to Stripe checkout for this product
- ✅ **Paystack Payment Link** - Redirects to Paystack checkout for this product
- ✅ **Bitcoin Address** - Shows BTC wallet for this product
- ✅ **Ethereum Address** - Shows ETH wallet for this product
- ✅ **USDT Address** - Shows USDT wallet for this product
