# ✅ Zoom Issue - FIXED!

## 🔧 **Problem Identified:**

The product details page was zooming the **entire screen** instead of just the image. This was caused by the Swiper Zoom module conflicting with the page layout.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Removed Zoom Module**
- ❌ Removed `Zoom` from Swiper modules
- ❌ Removed `zoom={true}` configuration

### **2. Added Hover Effect Instead**
- ✅ Images now have a subtle **scale effect on hover**
- ✅ Smooth 1.05x zoom on hover (no full-screen zoom)
- ✅ Better user experience without breaking the layout
