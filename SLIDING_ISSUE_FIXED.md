# ✅ Horizontal Sliding Issue - FIXED!

## 🔧 **Problem Identified:**

The product details page was **sliding horizontally** and images kept disappearing off-screen. The entire page content was continuously sliding away, making it impossible to see anything.

### **Root Cause:**
- **Auto-play enabled** on the Swiper carousel
- Images were cycling automatically every 3-4 seconds
- **Loop mode** was causing continuous sliding
- No way to stop the automatic sliding

- ✅ Now images stay in place!

### **2. Manual Navigation Only**
- ✅ Users control image changes with **arrow buttons**
- ✅ Users control image changes with **thumbnail clicks**
- ✅ Users control image changes with **pagination dots**
- ✅ Users control image changes with **swipe gestures** (mobile)
- ✅ **No automatic sliding!**

### **3. Fixed Container Width**
