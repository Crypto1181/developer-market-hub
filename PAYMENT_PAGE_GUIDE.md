## 📝 **Recommended Payment Methods:**

Based on your marketplace:

1. **Stripe** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Pros: Easy integration, trusted, supports cards worldwide
   - Cons: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
   - Best for: All types of digital products

2. **PayPal** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Pros: Widely trusted, buyer protection
   - Cons: Higher fees, can hold funds
   - Best for: International customers

3. **Cryptocurrency** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Pros: Lower fees, no chargebacks, anonymous
   - Cons: Volatility, less mainstream
   - Best for: Tech-savvy customers, high-value items

### **My Recommendation:**
Start with **Stripe** (easiest to set up) and add PayPal later. Add Crypto if your audience requests it.
